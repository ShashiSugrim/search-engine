## To run, you can use jar inside build/libs folder
`java -jar Task9-all.jar -SEARCH=QUERY "how many pcs are there in the world?" -GUI=both`

## to Compile
`gradle shadowJar`

## Note
There is a front-end I made with Next.js that uses this as the backend. Currently, the front-end is not open sourced, but you can access the website: https://banana-search.pages.dev/
