Only need to use the searcher and stemmer. But remember that there needs to be the stoplists and inverted_index.txt and documents_id_map.txt already generated from when initializing the system. There also needs to be HTML files in the current directory as the searcher
To run: java -jar Task9-all.jar -SEARCH=QUERY "how many pcs are there in the world?" -GUI=false
To filter the results after running the above command, use grep to filter only the document ids: cat precisionTest.txt | grep -E "Document ID:|query"
